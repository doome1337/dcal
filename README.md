# dcal
A simple calendar utility.

I got tired of keeping track of when assignments are due, and when I have my next class, and so on and so forth.

So I wrote this over the span of a few days.

You can add tasks with the add command, and provide a due date.

Then, you can retrieve it with the display command.
