Implement inter: Interactive mode.
Implement add-rec: Add recurring tasks.
    Addendum: Implement management of recurring tasks in general.
Implement categories: Add setting of tasks into categories during addition,
    and during display.
    Have -p be shorthand for the special -c 'priority' category.
Figure out if Google Calendar has an API.
Figure out how to add this to the path
    without relying on setting the path to the containing folder.

About categories:
    We have infrastructure in place already:
        The task codes.
    We can rebuild those.
    Make the str-format be based by searching through the list of cats,
        and picking the first where the code is contained in the task-cat.
        Make the last one be "".
        Thus, every task will have some match used for display.
        CODE:
        for every task:
            for every code:
                if code in task.code:
                    format = code.format
        last code is "", guaranteeing a match.
        By doing this, we have easy subcategories.
        Has weakness of possible accidental overlap.
    Priority should be in order it appears in ~/.dcalcode
    Should probably represent it via "cat1/cat2/cat3/..." for multiple cats.
