Task File Format:
    <name>,year,month,day,hour,minute,second,task_code
    
    <name> is the name of the task.
    The next 6 are all integer values for when events happen.
    Task_Code represents what type of task this is.

Task Codes:
    While task codes will eventually be modifiable by the user,
        they are currently locked in as follows:
   -2: Recurring Task
   -1: Recurring, Delayable Task
    0: Incomplete Task
    1: Task Complete, but Requires Revision
    2: Task Fully Complete

    Recurring Task:
        An event that happens every week.
        These are automatically generated by dcal gen.
        These are things like lectures, or jobs.
        These tasks happen regardless of action.
        Thus, they are automatically cleaned upon time going over.
    Recurring, Delayable Task:
        An event that happens every week.
        These are automatically generated by dcal gen.
        These are things like regular doctor check-ups,
        or bus ticket purchases.
        These tasks do not happen, but are regular.
        These are not automatically cleaned up, only generated.
    Incomplete Task:
        An event which is not complete yet.
        Not cleaned up.
        These get among the highest priority.
    Task Complete, but Requires Revision:
        These are tasks which have been done,
        but could still be edited.
        These are not cleaned up,
        but have low priority.
    Task Complete:
        A task that has been done.
        These are tasks which you don't need to be kept track of.
        These are automatically cleaned up.

Generator File Format:
    <name>,<weekday>,hour,minute,second,<delayable>

    <name> is the name of the task.
    <weekday> is the day of the week (0=Sunday,1=Monday,etc.)
    The next 6 represent the time of the event.
    <delayable> indicates whether the task can be done even if delayed.

Task_Code File Format:
    <code>,<clean on time up>,<clean in general>,<priority>,<ots>,<late str>

    <code> is the task code we're defining.
    <clean on time up> determines if the task is cleaned 
        if the deadline has passed.
    <clean in general> determines if the task is cleaned
        regardless of if it passed.
    <priority> is the priority of the task.
        Higher priority tasks are displayed higher up.
    <ots> is the format for on-time messages.
        These contain "%N" for task names
        and "%T" for time until/after the task.
        This is always positive.
        Before or after determined by whether <ots> or <late str> used.
        "%A" can be used for absolute time it's due.
    <late str> is the format for late messages.
        The formats are the same as for <ots>.
