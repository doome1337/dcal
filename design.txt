Task File Format:
    <name>,year,month,day,hour,minute,second,task_code
    
    <name> is the name of the task.
    The next 6 are all integer values for when events happen.
    Task_Code represents what type of task this is.

Task Codes:
    While task codes will eventually be modifiable by the user,
        they are currently locked in as follows:
   -2: Recurring Task
   -1: Recurring, Delayable Task
    0: Incomplete Task
    1: Task Complete, but Requires Revision
    2: Task Fully Complete

    Recurring Task:
        An event that happens every week.
        These are automatically generated by dcal gen.
        These are things like lectures, or jobs.
        These tasks happen regardless of action.
        Thus, they are automatically cleaned upon time going over.
    Recurring, Delayable Task:
        An event that happens every week.
        These are automatically generated by dcal gen.
        These are things like regular doctor check-ups,
        or bus ticket purchases.
        These tasks do not happen, but are regular.
        These are not automatically cleaned up, only generated.
    Incomplete Task:
        An event which is not complete yet.
        Not cleaned up.
        These get among the highest priority.
    Task Complete, but Requires Revision:
        These are tasks which have been done,
        but could still be edited.
        These are not cleaned up,
        but have low priority.
    Task Complete:
        A task that has been done.
        These are tasks which you don't need to be kept track of.
        These are automatically cleaned up.

Generator File Format:
    <name>,<weekday>,hour,minute,second

    <name> is the name of the task.
    <weekday> is the day of the week (0=Sunday,1=Monday,etc.)
    The next 6 represent the time of the event.
